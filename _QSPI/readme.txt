This is a reduced file system and the firmware to use the QSPI flash on the ezLCD as opposed to the SD card. The advantage is longer life 
and cost savings and reliability. Slightly slower read and write times are the disadvantage and only 16MB of storage versus a hughe 8GB or 
more with the SD card version in the root of this directory. Please backup the SD card to your p.c. so you have backups of all the sofware 
for both versions and more importantly the documentation.
