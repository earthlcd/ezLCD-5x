1.0 OVERVIEW:
--
Thank you for purchasing a 5th generation ezLCD! The ezLCD firmware includes
a set of optimized routines for building graphical user (GUI) interfaces, drawing and accessing the input/output (I/O) interfaces on your ezLCD. 
This API can be accessed through a port such as TTL serial, RS-232, SPI, CANbus or USB on the ezLCD or through the Lua scripting language also in the firmware.. You can use a separate microcontroller (or Arduino) to talk to the ezLCD API through the ezLCD command port for your project.
If you choose to use Lua scripting languages the  ezLCD can be a separate touch screen based product! It is ideal for HMI, PLC, instruments, medical devices,
home automation panels, IOT controllers and interactive digital signs the ezLCD's applications are only limited by your imagination.

This document is a prelude to the complete ezLCD product manual for your model.

2.0 GET STARTED:
--
2.1) Plug a USB cable from the ezLCD to your computer.
2.2) A flash drive will pop on your computer. Copy the contents of the ezLCD flash drive directory to your PC as a backup.
(If the ezLCD is in demo mode the autoexec.lua file will begin running on the ezLCD screen. After you watch this you can rename it or delete it
and reset or unplug the ezLCD to stop the demo.
2.3) At this point if you plan on using only the ezLCD API in your project you can skip to 4.0 Installing the ezLCD Utility. To see the
full capability you still may want to go through the Lua Quick Start as it will allow you to prototype your projects visual appearance quicker 
and see the features of the ezLCD from the many examples in the Lua scripts directory provide on the ezLCD flash drive.

3.0 LUA QUICKSTART
--
3.1 Install Notepad++ from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ and install.
3.2 In Notepad++ use the menu option Plugin > Open Plugins Folder .
3.3 Create a folder named ezLCDLua.
3.4 Copy the ezLCDLua.dll file provided on your ezLCD from the Notepad++ folder into the ezLCDLua folder.
3.5 Close and reopen Notepad++
3.6 Use the menu option Plugin > ezLCD Lua > Edit Config File
3.7 Using Windows 10 "Device Manager" click on "Ports (COM & LPT)". You should see a line that says USB Serial Device (COMxx) 
    where xx is a number. 
3.8 In the config file replace the 1 in COM1 with whatever number is shown in the device manager and SAVE the file.
3.9 Use the menu option Plugin > ezLCD Lua > Show Console
3.10 Now you can input commands into the 5x via the notepad++ console, such as "ez.Cls(ez.RGB(255, 0, 0))"
3.11 You can also run Lua files, by opening a .lua file in Notepad++ and pressing CTRL + e.
3.12 To run a Lua script on startup, place the Lua file into the device's root directory, and rename the file "autoexec.lua".
3.13 We encourage you to run all the scripts in the lua directory to become familiar with their capability.

4.0 INSTALLING AND USING THE EZLCD UTILITY
--
4.1 Install ezLCD Utility by running the .exe file in the ezLCD_Utility directory THEN Run the ezLCD4xx_Config_Utility from your personal computer  
4.2 In the LCD selection pull down select ezLCD-5035-RT then click APPLY Button
4.3 Click DISPLAY TEST then click SCAN PORTS and click OPEN 
The bottom of the screen will display connected to COM1 (1=whatever USB port the ezLCD is at)
4.4 In the Projects Tab Click Lua on the left menu ribbon. Next to the RUN_LUA_SD type lua/hello.lua and then click the RUN_LUA_SD button. The screen should turn blue and print "Hello World!!!" in gold.
Note: You can also open the script with your editor and paste in the "Run Lua commands over API" screen below and click the RUN_LUA button to run it. Also you can do edits in there also and re-run it. It is suggested you reset the ezLCD after every script . You will need to go back to the Connection Menu to CLOSE and OPEN the port to reconnect it.
For Lua we recommend to just use Notepad++ for creating AND downloading Lua scripts to your ezLCD!
IMPORTANT: DO NOT HAVE NOTEPAD++ OPEN AND CONNECTED TO THE EZLCD AT SAME TIME AS THE EZLCD CONFIG UTILITY

5.0 FIRMWARE UPGRADE:
--
Your ezLCD ships from the factory with the latest version but if an upgrade is released this is how it is installed.
5.1 Launch the ezLCD Utility
5.2 In the LCD selection pull down to select the ezLCD model you have then then click APPLY Button.
5.3 Click on the “Update Firmware” Tab.
5.4 Click on the “OPEN” Button.
5.6 Navigate to the ezLCD firmware file on your PC (ezLCDnnnn-xxxx.dfu).
5.7 Plug in your ezLCD to the USB
5.8 Press & Hold the “RESET” Button,  Press & Hold the “Boot 0” Button (NOTE: 10x/Proto models hold BOOT button down next to 
power switch while powering on unit). Screen should display no date and both LED on the SOM on the ezLCD should be off to signify
the ezLCD is in bootloader mode.
5.9 Release the “RESET” Button,  Release the “Boot 0” Button
5.10 Click on the “UPDATE” Button

6.0  ABOUT THE DOCUMENTATION
(Supplied in the \Documentation directory of your ezLCD's Flash Drive)
6.1  "Quick Start" (This Document in the root of your ezLCD flash drive) - Provides "Quick Start" instructions. Describes how to connect and verify operation of your ezLCD. 
Describes how to load a new firmware and how to customize your ezLCD device. 
6.2 "ezLCD API Manual" - Common for all ezLCD-5x products. Describes the set of commands, which can be sent to the ezLCD through any of the implemented 
interfaces (USB, RS232, SPI, WIFII etc.). Those commands may be sent by an external host (PC or microcontroller) or by a scripting language such as Lua running on the ezLCD. 
6.3 "ezLCD Lua  Manual" - Common for all ezLCD-5x products. All ezLCD-5x products have an embedded Lua interpreter. ezLCD Lua has been developed to access all graphic and I/O capabilities of the ezLCD API using the Lua language. These commands are the Lua commands that are specific to the ezLCD and will start with “ez.” such as ez.Cls() . You can use a resource below to learn the standard Lua commands. 
6.4 “Programming in Lua (Fourth  edition) By Roberto Lerusalimschy”** This is the definitive book for Lua as it is wrote by the creator of the language and describes the general commands. The official book about the Lua programming language wrote by the creator of the language and describes the general commands . It is available at: 
6.5 Original Edition is a available online at the link in the document directory. Note you need the Lua documentation for the base language and the ezLCD Lua manual for ezLCD graphic and I/O commands.
6.6 Lua Examples - In the \lua directory on your ezLCD there are many examples. learn.lua shows the most common commands. blink.lua shows how to access an ezLCD  I/O signal. showall.lua  shows many graphic commands.
[RUN THESE PROGRAMS BY OPENING THEM IN NOTEPAD++ AND CLICKING ON THEM AND THEN PRESS THE CTRL KEY AND THE E KEY SIMUTANEOUSLY]
6.7 More information about Lua can be found at: http://www.lua.org/ and there are many videos on YouTube for learning Lua. 

7.0 TIPS:
--
1) Graphical touch button jpeg images  for your user interface can be easily created at this website: https://www.clickminded.com/button-generator/
2) For most graphics design, converting to jpeg, scaling using Paint in Windows 10 or later is sufficient.
3) Since Lua scripts that fail leave memory messy; reset or power down your ezLCD to retest an edited script.
